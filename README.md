# Kadaster Tech & Data Dag 2022 FoodNTFs

Created with [Studio721](https://www.721.so/) which is an awesome online development environment to develop and publish NFTs of some sort.

This repository contains the sources for the FoodNFTs developed for the Kadaster Tech & Data Dag 2022 on May 19th, 2022. The idea is to distribute prepared wallets to all registered participants. Each wallet contains a single NFT from the FoodNFTs collection. By transfering ownership of the single NFT in your wallet you will be able to collect some food at the conference :sunglasses:

Current version is published on IPFS using [NFT Storage](https://nft.storage/) (awesome tip!)
